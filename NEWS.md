esci version 1.0.2 (Release data: March 2024)
===========

Changes:

* First release to CRAN. Module is now complete, documented, and has relatively
complete test coverage.  This is still a pretty rough attempt, though.  Expect 
breaking changes still to come, especially with graphing functions.
