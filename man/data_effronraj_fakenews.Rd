\description{
\emph{Synthetic data} meant to represent Experiment 1 of Effron & Raj, 2020.
138 U.S. adults, recruited in August 2018 on Prolific Academic, worked
online. First, they saw six fake headlines four times, each time being asked
to rate how interesting/engaging/ funny/well-written the headline was. This
rating task simply ensured that the participants paid some attention to each
headline. The stimuli were 12 actual fake-news headlines about American
politics, with accompanying photographs. Half appealed to Republicans and
half to Democrats. Later, 12 fake headlines were presented one at a time, a
random mix of the six Old headlines-those seen before-and six New headlines
not seen previously. It was stated very clearly that independent,
non-partisan fact-checking had established that all the headlines were not
true. Participants first rated, on a 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely) scale,
the degree to which to which they judged it unethical to publish that
headline. That's the Unethicality DV. They also rated how likely they would
be to share the headline if they saw it posted by an acquaintance on social
media; there were three further similar ratings. Finally, they rated how
accurate they believed the headline to be.
