\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe or tibble}

\item{means}{A collection of study means, 1 per study}

\item{sds}{A collection of study standard deviations, 1 per study, all >0}

\item{ns}{A collection of sample sizes, 1 per study, all integers > 2}

\item{labels}{An optional collection of study labels}

\item{moderator}{An optional factor to analyze as a categorical moderator,
must have k > 2 per groups}

\item{contrast}{An optional contrast to estimate between moderator levels;
express as a vector of contrast weights with 1 weight per moderator level.}

\item{effect_label}{Optional character giving a human-friendly name of
the effect being synthesized}

\item{reference_mean}{Optional reference mean, defaults to 0}

\item{reported_effect_size}{Character specifying effect size to return; Must
be one of 'mean_difference', 'smd_unbiased' (to return an unbiased Cohen's
d1) or 'smd' (to return Cohen's d1 without correction for bias)}

\item{random_effects}{TRUE for random effect model; FALSE for fixed effects}

\item{conf_level}{The confidence level for the confidence interval.  Given in
decimal form.  Defaults to 0.95.}

\description{
\code{meta_mean} is suitable for synthesizing across multiple single-group studies
with a continuous outcome variable when all studies are measured on the
same scale.
}
\details{
The meta-analytic effect size, confidence interval and heterogeneity
estimates all come from \code{\link[metafor:rma.uni]{metafor::rma()}}.

The diamond ratio and its confidence interval come from
\code{\link[=CI_diamond_ratio]{CI_diamond_ratio()}}.

If reported_effect_size is smd_unbiased or smd the conversion to d1
is handled by \code{\link[=CI_smd_one]{CI_smd_one()}}.
