\description{
To what extent do men and women differ in their attitudes towards
mathematics? To investigate, Nosek et al. (2002) asked male and female
students to complete an Implicit Association Test (IAT)-this is a task
designed to measure a participant's implicit (non-conscious) feelings towards
a topic. (If you've never heard of the IAT, try it out here:
tiny.cc/harvardiat) On this IAT, students were tested for negative feelings
towards mathematics and art. Scores reflect the degree to which a student had
more negative implicit attitudes about mathematics than art (positive score:
more negative feelings about mathematics; 0: same level of negativity to
both; negative score: more negative feelings about art). data_gender_math_iat
has data from two labs that participated in a large-scale replication of the
original study (Klein et al., 2014a, 2014b)
