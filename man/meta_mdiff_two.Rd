\description{
\code{meta_mdiff_two} is suitable for synthesizing across multiple two-group
studies (paired or independent) with a continuous outcome measure.  It takes
in raw data from each study.  If all studies used the same measurement scale,
a meta-analytic raw-score difference can be returned.  If studies used
different scales, a standardized mean difference can be returned.
Studies can be all paired, all independent, or a mix.  Equal variance can
be assumed, or not.  If standardized mean difference is the output, it is
d_s when equal variance is assumed and d_avg when equal variance is not
assumed.

\details{
Once you generate an estimate with this function, you can visualize
it with \code{\link[=plot_meta]{plot_meta()}}.

The meta-analytic effect size, confidence interval and heterogeneity
estimates all come from \code{\link[metafor:rma.uni]{metafor::rma()}}.

The diamond ratio and its confidence interval come from
\code{\link[=CI_diamond_ratio]{CI_diamond_ratio()}}.

If reported_effect_size is smd_unbiased or smd the conversion to Cohen's d
is handled by \code{\link[=CI_smd_ind_contrast]{CI_smd_ind_contrast()}}.
