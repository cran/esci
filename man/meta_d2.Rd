\description{
\code{meta_d2} is suitable for synthesizing across multiple two-group studies
(paired or independent) with a continuous outcome measure but where not
all studies are measured on the same scale, and instead the magnitude of
difference for each study is expressed as d_s or d_avg.
}
\details{
Once you generate an estimate with this function, you can visualize
it with \code{\link[=plot_meta]{plot_meta()}}.

Each study's effect size should be expressed as:
Cohen's d_s: (comparison_mean - reference_mean) / sd_pooled
or
Cohen_'s d_avg: (comparison_mean - reference_mean) / sd_avg

To enter d_s, set assume_equal_variance to TRUE
To enter d_avg, set assume_equal_variance to FALSE

And the d values should all be corrected for bias.
The function \code{\link[=CI_smd_ind_contrast]{CI_smd_ind_contrast()}} can assist with converting
raw data from each study to d_s or d_avg with bias correction.  It also
has more details on calculation of these forms of d and their CIs.

The meta-analytic effect size, confidence interval and heterogeneity
estimates all come from \code{\link[metafor:rma.uni]{metafor::rma()}}.

The diamond ratio and its confidence interval come from
\code{\link[=CI_diamond_ratio]{CI_diamond_ratio()}}.
