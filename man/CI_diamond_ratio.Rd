\usage{
CI_diamond_ratio(RE, FE, vi, conf_level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{RE}{metafor object with random effects result}

\item{FE}{metafor object with fixed effects result}

\item{vi}{vector of effect size variances}

\item{conf_level}{The confidence level for the confidence interval.  Given in
decimal form.  Defaults to 0.95.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with 3 properties:
\itemize{
\item diamond_ratio
\item LL - lower limit of the conf_level\% CI, Sub-Q approach
\item UL - upper limit of the conf_level\% CI, Sub-Q approach
\item LL_bWT_DL  - lower limit of the conf_level\% CI, bWT-DL approach
\item UL_bWT_DL  - upper limit of the conf_level\% CI, bWT-DL approach
}
}
\description{
\code{CI_diamond_ratio} returns the diamond ratio and CI for a
meta-analytic effect, the ratio of the random-effects CI width to the
fixed-effects CI width.  The diamond ratio is a measure of effect-size
heterogeneity.
}
\details{
Calculation of the CI is based on code provided by Maxwell Cairns
(see Cairns et al., 2022).  Specifically, this function implements what
Cairns et al (2022) called the Sub-Q approach, which
provides the best CI coverage in simulations.  For comparison, this
function also returns the CI produced by the bWT-DL approach (which
generally has worse performance).
