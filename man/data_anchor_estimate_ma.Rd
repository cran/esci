\description{
To what extent does the wording of a question influence one's judgment? In
their classic study, Jacowitz and Kahneman (1995) asked participants to
estimate how many babies are born each day in the United States. Participants
were given either a low anchor (more than 100 babies/day) or a high anchor
(less than 50,000 babies/day). Those who saw the low anchor estimated many
fewer births/day than those who saw the high anchor, which suggests that the
wording can have a profound influence. The correct answer, as it happens, is
~11,000 births/day in 2014. To investigate the extent that these results are
replicable, the Many Labs project repeated this classic study at many
different labs around the world. You can find the summary data for 30 of
these labs in the Anchor Estimate ma data file
