\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble with columns}

\item{yi}{Name a column in data containing the effect size for each study}

\item{vi}{Name of a column in data containing the expected sampling variance
for each study}

\item{labels}{Name of a column in data containing a label for each study}

\item{moderator}{Optional name of a column in data containing a factor as a
categorical moderator}

\item{contrast}{Optional vector specifying a contrast analysis for the
categorical moderator.  Only define if a moderator is defined; vector
length should match number of levels in the moderator}

\item{effect_label}{Optional human-friendly name for the effect being
synthesized; defaults to 'My effect'}

\item{effect_size_name}{Optional human-friendly name of the effect size being
synthesized; defaults to 'Effect size'}

\item{moderator_variable_name}{Optional human-friendly name of the moderator,
if defined; If not passed but a moderator is defined, will be set to the
quoted name of the moderator column or 'My moderator'}

\item{random_effects}{Use TRUE to obtain a random effect meta-analysis
(usually recommended); FALSE for fixed effect.}

\item{conf_level}{The confidence level for the confidence interval.  Given in
decimal form.  Defaults to 0.95.}

\description{
\code{meta_any} is suitable for synthesizing any effect size across
multiple studies.  You must provide the effect size for each study and the
predicted sampling variance for each study.

\details{
#' Once you generate an estimate with this function, you can visualize
it with \code{\link[=plot_meta]{plot_meta()}}.

The meta-analytic effect size, confidence interval and heterogeneity
estimates all come from \code{\link[metafor:rma.uni]{metafor::rma()}}.

The diamond ratio and its confidence interval come from
\code{\link[=CI_diamond_ratio]{CI_diamond_ratio()}}.
