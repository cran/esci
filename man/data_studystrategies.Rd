\description{
To what extent does study strategy influence learning? To investigate,
psychology students were randomly assigned to three groups and asked to learn
biology facts using one of three different strategies: a) Self-Explain
(explaining for each fact what new knowledge is gained and how it relates to
what is already known), b) Elab Interrogation (elaborative interrogation:
stating for each fact why it makes sense), or c) Repetition Control (stating
each fact over and over). After studying, students took a 25-point
fill-the-blank test (O'Reilly et al., 1998)
